Is the feedback conclusive?

is there Knowledge progress evident over the course of the uploads?

How are participants utilizing the archive afterwards?

=== Effectiveness of the Workshop Model

The workshop format, inspired by the Bauhaus "Materialstudien" #footnote[see @materialstudien], successfully encouraged direct engagement with plastic, fostering an appreciation of its material properties.

Rubbish Theory #cite(<thompsonRubbishTheoryCreation2017>) suggests that value is socially constructed; the workshop demonstrated that hands-on interaction can shift an object’s category from "rubbish" to a valuable resource.

The Temporary Autonomous Zone #cite(<beyTAZTemporaryAutonomous2011>) framework can be applied to the workshop as a performative space where participants were freed from conventional consumerist waste narratives and could redefine plastic through material exploration.

=== Transformation of Material Perception
Material Ecocriticism and the concept of storied bodies #cite(<iovinoMaterialEcocriticism2014>) suggest that materials carry histories and embedded narratives.
Participants shifted from viewing plastic as mere waste to recognizing it as part of a circular material story, shaping its second life through hands-on interventions.

Transmattering #cite(<Żyniewicz_2023>): The process of physically manipulating plastics helped participants rewrite its meaning, moving it from a disposable item to an object of potential durability and craftsmanship.

We could observe that meaning-making is an embedded process. 
It is not simply done by taking off conventional associations and attaching new ones: 
The context we do it in, defines ou


== Outlook and future directions
TODO

What are the next steps?
What could be done further?
Workshop format in schools
the Archive could be expanded
Skill Trees for all kinds of material transformations could be invented.
One idea is to explore expanding the wonderfully gamified levelling system of Steph #cite(<piperSkillSeekerColor2024>, form: "prose") into a more expansive, multi-material framework that includes plastic recycling as one aspect. The playful learning approach to making is something that we will explore further in our work with studio einszwovier.
There is also some potential in combining the physical skill-points with the kind of digital backbone the automated archive could provide.

The Role of Play and Experimentation:
Future workshops could integrate gamified knowledge-building approaches as in #cite(<piperSkillSeekerColor2024>, form: "prose") , where participants "level up" their skills in material transformation.
A "skill tree" for waste materials could be developed, guiding participants through progressive challenges in plastic manipulation and reuse.


=== Speculation
TODO

What might a future application look like?
In future workshops, participants will continue to engage in hands-on activities that transform waste materials into functional objects.
An area of deeper investigation will be the integration of digital fabrication tools and techniques alongside traditional methods
How do I expect the Format to scale?
Is that something desirable?
What will happen to the archive?
Are there ways to attach permanency?


Speculation: The Future of Recycling as a Cultural Practice
Can we reframe waste through participatory art and education?
If plastic is viewed as a cultural artifact rather than just waste, could it be archived, exhibited, or treated as a medium for artistic and social commentary?


In anarchism, there is a pretty old debate about the structure of the anti-capitalist Revolution: There is the idea of a violent struggle a la Lenin, but there is also proponents of a seed-building culture.

--> Establish nodes where meaning and value do not conform to the overall norm

The more nodes and seed-places there are, the closer we are to a _permanent_ autonomous zone, one that can reasonably be understood as a sustainable utopia.

Should we design more spaces that function as Temporary Autonomous Zones, where discarded materials are creatively explored outside capitalist production cycles?

How can artistic peer-learning look like?

What are instances where Infrastructure can foster co-creation and enable learning environments?
Where can the digital meaningfully support physical creation?
