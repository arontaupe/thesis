//With reference to existing waste management systems, alternative concepts for collaborative participation in recycling processes will be developed. Methods for the investigation of human-waste relationships will be applied, as well as practical investigations to create a socially transformative relationship to the value and non-value of waste.
With reference to existing waste management systems, alternative concepts for collaborative participation in recycling processes will be developed. 
By examining the historical and material contexts of plastics, this thesis explores the role of making and hacking as transformative practices in waste revaluation. 
Methods for the investigation of human-waste relationships will be applied, drawing on theories such as Rubbish Theory and Material studies, which highlight the shifting perception of objects between value and non-value. 
Additionally, practical investigations, including workshop-based experiments with polymer identification and machine-based interventions, will provide hands-on insights into the material properties of discarded plastics. 
Novel archiving practices will be introduced, together creating a novel methodology for artistic research and practice.
Through these approaches, this research aims to foster a socially transformative relationship to waste, emphasizing participation, design, and speculative approaches to material reuse. 
The findings will be evaluated based on participant feedback and workshop outcomes, contributing to a broader discussion on waste as both a challenge and an opportunity for sustainable futures and a material reality of the human experience.
