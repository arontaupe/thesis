This section serves to draw on several already existing notions on trash and plastics, it provides all the tools necessary to follow the conceptualization of the workshop and its process, presented thereafter in @sec:workshop.

== Histories of valued matter


=== History of Plastics

Bakelite was the first petrochemically-derived plastic to be discovered and quickly took to productive and consumptive processes. it was immediately recognized as the wonder-material it truly is #cite(<montoyaBakeliteVintagePlastic2024>).
After many worldwide experiments with Casein, Cellulite and other malleable materials #footnote[these were sometimes quite successful, like the celluloid film by Kodak that made the company] that could replace the expensive use of horn and bones as durable, yet moldable materials, Baekeland was the first to use pressure. 
He made the Bakelizer, a device that could apply pressure to a mixture of phenol and formaldehyde.
On first success on June 20, 1907, he wrote:
#quote(attribution: cite(<fenichellPlasticMakingSynthetic1996>, supplement: "p.90"), quotes: true)[
A solidified matter, yellowish and hard ... This looks
promising and it will be worthwhile to determine how far this
mass ... is able to make molded materials, either alone or in conjunction with other solid materials, as for instance asbestos, casein, zinc oxide, starch, different inorganic powders and lamp black and thus make a substitute for celluloid and for hard rubber.]

After bakelite, industrial design transformed massively, and fast:
First came Cellophane, protecting Camels precious cigars from moisture #cite(<fenichellPlasticMakingSynthetic1996>, supplement: "p. 107"),
then Nylon in 1930, finally making cheaper stockings than silk #cite(<fenichellPlasticMakingSynthetic1996>, supplement: "p. 135").
Not long after, in 1940, Henry Ford saved a huge chunk of the available metal supply for the potential war effort, by fabricating the first Ford - Car chassis from Vinyl (or PVC) #cite(<fenichellPlasticMakingSynthetic1996>, supplement: "p. 176").

There is not a single area of consumption that has not been impacted by the advent of synthetic polymers.

Although no synthetic polymers at all were produced before 1907, and only less
than half a million tonnes were produced annually by 1950, by 2016,
global plastics production reached 335 million tonnes per annum.
#cite(<PlasticsEurope2018>).
The production of synthetic polymers has skyrocketed, becoming virtually interchangeable with the term "plastic." As a result, other types of plastics are typically distinguished with prefixes like "natural" or "bioplastics."
#cite(<farrellyPlasticLegaciesPollution2021>, supplement: "p. 2").
As a consequence, or maybe also because plastic was so versatile and malleable, simply _plastic_, roughly half of the designs in the book "100 designs, 100 years: innovative designs of the 20th century" #cite(<byars100Designs1001999>) are fabricated with plastics.

Many of the devastating effects of plastics in our everyday life were then only slowly discovered in the 70ies and 80ies. The first major plastic pollution event was the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, which was discovered in 1988.

The much heralded durability of the new materials proved too much for us to stomach: Due to their chemical composition, plastics are not easily broken down by bacteria or other organisms, causing them to persist in the environment. By now it should be clear that consuming plastics (and microplastics, nanoplastics) is harmful and should by avoided by people and all living organisms.

Its just that we have no real choice in the matter, and non-human agents even less so: Literally every animal tested so far at the bottom of the 10-kilometer-deep Mariana Trench, one of the most isolated places on Earth, was found to have ingested plastic.
#cite(<jamiesonBioaccumulationPersistentOrganic2017>)

Plastics are now a part of nature, and there are often unpredictable ways of entanglement between human and non-human bodies, discourses, and materials
Plastics can no longer be presented as lifeless and apolitical material. It is not inert, it is made matter, storied bodies.

=== History of Trash

In the Book "Müll: eine Schmutzige Geschichte der Menschheit" by" #cite(<kosterMullSchmutzigeGeschichte2024>, form: "prose"), Trash is shown to be closely intertwined with capitalism and the resulting overproduction. Pre-capitalist societies did often not even have a concept of waste, as it was simply not a necessary concept. Waste was either not produced in the first place or it took a form that simply reintegrated into either a productive cycle or a natural process. #cite(<kosterMullSchmutzigeGeschichte2024>, supplement: "p. 15")
Köster also observes that trash is from its inception a valued category. It always comes with the association of "dirtiness", devaluation and general repulsiveness. #cite(<kosterMullSchmutzigeGeschichte2024>, supplement: "pp. 11ff")

He identifies scavenging specifically as a practice generating expert knowledge, with  uniquely efficient techniques for identifying and isolating plastics and other waste not yet reproduced in industrialized contexts.
#cite(<kosterMullSchmutzigeGeschichte2024>, supplement: "pp. 298ff")
Plastics transformed scavenging industries and also the dependent handiworks. Craft workers previously primarily working with scavenged metals quickly switched and retrained working materials towards plastics, since it is in many regards more convenient, easier to scavenge and easier to form and also less resistant to DIY-Forms of recycling.
#cite(<kosterMullSchmutzigeGeschichte2024>, supplement: "pp. 298ff")
Whether or not recycling happens, is historically strongly aligned with the available infrastructure for it. The fact that glass has one of the highest recycling rates worldwide is not only due to material properties, but also because it has a long history of politics establishing infrastructures for collection and recirculation.
#cite(<kosterMullSchmutzigeGeschichte2024>, supplement: "pp. 293ff")


With Plastics, this infrastructure took particularly long to establish, because of the sheer variety and lack of regulation at point of production.
A prominent german example is the "Grüner Punkt", which got established in 1990 and had an especially hard time growing the support necessary from a larger population in order to be effective.
Once established, infrastructures developed a performativity that turned recycling into a widespread behavior in the first place: the glass container served as a daily reminder of the possibility of reuse. A similar effect occurred later with the various bins made available to citizens. Ultimately, it was this everyday presence that made recycling increasingly indispensable.
#cite(<kosterMullSchmutzigeGeschichte2024>, supplement: "p. 293") #footnote[a similar development can be observed in another, more US-Centric publication: "Waste and Want" #cite(<strasserWasteWantSocial2000>)]

Extrapolating that for the workshop The workshop is purely infrastructure. 
It will provide performative transformation through providing a space for exploration, without the need for a full education in material science.
It is posed that just the guided and playful contact with the material is enough to change perceptions and create appreciation on a material level.

== Concepts for re-narration of object-value <crucialconcepts>

=== Rubbish Theory

In the Book "Rubbish Theory" by #cite(<thompsonRubbishTheoryCreation2017>, form: "prose",) the author argues that the value of an object is not inherent to the object itself, but rather a social construct. 
This is especially true for waste, which is often considered valueless and disposable. However, Thompson contends that waste can be transformed into value through social, cultural, and economic processes. 
By reevaluating our perceptions of waste and its potential, we can create new systems of value that promote sustainability and resourcefulness. This aims to go beyond teaching the participants how to recycle, but to fundamentally change their relationship to waste and the materials around them.

The Book establishes three fundamental value classes, transient, durable and rubbish. The Categories _transient_ and _durable_ are not new here, they have been around in design theories for quite a while.
//#cite()
TODO cite

A transient object is simply an object expected to decrease in value over time, while a durable object is expected to increase in value over time. The third category, rubbish, is the novel concept introduced here.
Upon this basic theorem, a whole field of study came to be: the discard studies #cite(<hirdKnowingWasteInhuman2012>).


==== Knowing Waste <knowingwaste>
Hird can bring feminist epistemology to the table, helping to dissect the "twilight category" of waste as something that is intentionally ill defined. As such we need theories like Haraway's _Cyborg_ and Barad's Onto-epistemology, later discussed in @material_ecocriticism.

According to Hird, waste is not technologically containable. 
It fails to be determined, to be predicted, to be categorized.
The only way waste seems to be feasibly contained is through human norms and social practices. Knowing waste is therefore a necessity for survival.

=== A Bauhaus Example: Materialstudien <materialstudien>

As visible here, #cite(<thegettyresearchinstituteBauhaus>) already the 1920s Bauhaus movement pioneered the idea that it might be a pedagogically useful exercise to restrict oneself to a certain set of materials, in order to explore the very base attributes of it. The Bauhaus tradition differentiates between "Materiestudien" and "Materialstudien", the former instigating students to look at the base properties of a material, to facilitate choosing the right material for specific tasks, while in the "Materialstudien" the students got consciously restricted to a single material to bring about novel and unexpected applications of it

The Bauhaus Vorkurs is an especially valuable reference, because it is an early example of how the Bauhaus movement sought to instigate students to explore the very base attributes of materials. The Vorkurs is a foundational course that introduces students to the fundamental principles of design and aesthetics, including the study of materials. Plastic, a material arguably very far from the intuitive artistic choices when choosing a material for a specific project, is thereby given a renewed focus and is encouraged to be explored through the lens of both aesthetics and functionality. It is given a shiny place on the central stage reserved for materials worthy of artisanship.

The present workshop adopts this approach by focusing on the material properties of plastic, encouraging unconventional uses and applications that challenge conventional perceptions of plastic. Here, exploration of techniques is fostered through a specific selection of tools presented to participants. Effectively, a Material study is conducted, where we focus on recycled plastic waste as the sole material but leave personal autonomy in workflow design and choice of method.

==== A continuation

TODO describe modern application and use

How are Materialstudien utilized in modern formulations of Design Education?
#cite(<lernerFoundationsDesignEducation2005>)


==== A modern Example
#quote(attribution: "Anne Holtrop", block: true, quotes: true)[In this studio, we will focus on the unique gestures dictated by a particular material and the specialisms of working that material in what we call ‘material gesture.’ We will explore the making in relation to a material in order to produce an architecture that is solely focused on the relationship between the two. Our interest in the material will be related to its properties, how it is mined, its use in industry, its effect on craftsmanship, specialized fabrication techniques, its cultural significance, and innovations in the field of architecture.

The research that is carried out in the studio will be largely developed through a practice-based approach, and applied throughout the intrinsic developments of the projects in the design studio. Each semester, a subtopic within material gesture will be explored ranging from an in-depth focus on one specific source material - gypsum, to the geological interest of a site, and the man-made materials from our current geological age, the Anthropocene.

The results will be collected in a growing physical database of materials, and its performance through its applications in the form of large architectural models, made in the actual researched materials and techniques.]

#cite(<MaterialGestureStudio2024>)

What to take from Holtrop?



==== Material Ecocriticism <material_ecocriticism>
serves to give us the concept of "_storied bodies_". 
Humans are storied bodies, and objects are too. 
We are material beings in a material world. 
Storytelling can thereby reframe and reinfluence everything.
#cite(<phillipsMaterialEcocriticismDirt2012>)

#quote(
  attribution: cite(<phillipsMaterialEcocriticismDirt2012>, supplement: "p.447"),
  quotes: true)[
    "Nevertheless, our capacity for storytelling and tool-making serves to extend our material bodies and the material processes in which they are enmeshed, not to sever us from them. We extend our material lives and bodies, and thereby we also extend and increase our material impact—which is to say we have never been immaterial since we first appeared on Earth, and will always be material so long as we remain here"
    ]


=== Transmattering

In a PHD thesis publication, "TRANSMATTERING IN THE MAKING" #cite(<Żyniewicz_2023>)
the author introduces the term _transmattering_ as a novel contribution, which describes a methodology of transforming matter with their respective attached meaning, building upon the "storied bodies", a central tool in the field of material Ecocriticism, building on Karen Barad and Serpil Oppermann, as introduced in @material_ecocriticism.

Matter and meaning are intertwined #cite(<baradMeetingUniverseHalfway2007>), meaning Ontology and Epistemology are not very intelligible as separate entities. Barad introduces Onto-epistemology to capture that.
If we then want to transform one storied body into another, we are not only performing an ontological operation, we are performing a narrative operation alongside.
For that to succeed, an object needs to have a certain disposition for transmattering, a narrative reformulation.

=== Liminality in object and space

What is a liminal object?

#quote(attribution: cite(<Liminality2025>), quotes: true)[The dissolution of order during Liminality creates a fluid, malleable situation that enables new institutions and customs to become established]

Liminality describes two things: It understands something to be in the background of something else, in a kind of forgotten state, and it also describes something to be hybrid, of malleable, uncertain status, like it is still to be decided.

#quote(attribution: cite(<thomassenLiminalityModern2016>), quotes: true)["Liminality refers to moments or periods of transition during which the normal limits to thought, self-understanding and behaviour are relaxed, opening the way to novelty and
imagination, construction and destruction."]

I understand the liminal as capturing the leftovers of what is meant in traditional Phenomenology (Husserl) by Bracketing, or the epoché.
Feminist Thinkers have long dissected the impossibility of that concept and instead focused on the other, the bracketed away, the liminal #cite(<ahmedQueerPhenomenologyOrientations2007>) as a useful epistemological tool.

In #cite(<Żyniewicz_2023>, form:"prose") the observer, the scientist, the acting human has to be liminal in order to perform the transmattering. The person needs to shed labels, definitions, dogmas and preconceptions of oneself and of the world, which is probably a good state to be in for the world-building happening in @taz.

Waste, and therefore plastics is potentially a liminal category, if we can approach it as such.

==== The T.A.Z - Temporary Autonomous Zone - a liminal space? <taz>

In the admittedly hard to follow musings about the Temporary Autonomous Zone (T.A.Z.) by the anarchist Peter Lamborn Wilson, under the pseudonym of Hakim Bey, #cite(<beyTAZTemporaryAutonomous2011>) we can glimpse something like a liminal space too:
The author creates a kind of performative spatiotemporal zone, where norms and hegemonial concepts are suspended. One could say, I believe, that "suspension of disbelief", a term used to describe narrative world-building in media, is a similar concept. Without a definition of a TAZ, which Bey intentionally refrained from, I have to introduce a bit of my own beliefs here.
The general concept there is a tactical one:
It is a collective act, which results in the construction of a meta-space, defying any and all structures of control. It is ontological rebellion, as a narrative act.

I would argue it is a liminal space, where semantics are dismantled, leaving space for the liberated creation of meaning.
Bey denotes this as the _Pirate Utopia_ crucial for political world-building, but i believe it serves as well as an Artistic Utopia, a liminal zone where objects can be revisited for the first time, yielding a unique opportunity for narrative creation.


==== What the Liminal can do for us
The liminal object is a similar category as the Rubbish by #cite(<thompsonRubbishTheoryCreation2017>), but it encompasses not only necessarily trash and thereby opens up the opportunity for a material as such to already undergo the desired transfer from transient to durable. The liminal object can be understood as an intermediary state between waste and art, where the material itself is not necessarily discarded but rather transformed into something new.

The liminal does even more for us: it does not only create the preconditions for re-narrating an object into an object of more value, which in itself already amount to alchemy;it also gives us a tool to grasp why communal Liminality is such a powerful mechanism: it gives us authorship and agency, a sensation of being in charge of a proper creative process.

The liminal is also a scary place: humans are habitual, getting robbed of habits, of norms, of established meaning is not by default a beautiful, or productive experience. The meaning created in a specific communal context is an elevated meaning, a sort of ritual. it is tied to its context, enriched by it. And taking the storied-object out of there, transferring it to another context is a delicate matter.

=== The problem of archiving

TODO back up with sources

In a learning process, even more so an artistic learning process, making knowledge persistent is a hard problem.
It is one thing to learn and study for a test and entirely another to transmit experiential and haptic knowledge.
All the little details found out during handling a material and intentionally transforming it, are very often lost in the transition from one person to another. We are social learners and doing something in a group already significantly changes the learning experience.
But then again it becomes an organizational problem of collective learning:
How do we harvest the marvelous diversity of approaches to a set of problems? How can we capture and utilize the superior epistemic position of a (diverse) group in a workshop context and create structured and persistent knowledge?
We need an archive. Such an archive will be used in the workshop and is discussed in @AutomatedArchive.

TODO where to put archive concept?

either put archive concept here or into the workshop description, along with the realization
