= Evaluation <sec:evaluation>

In this section, I will now mostly abandon the findings and results presented by the participants and instead concentrate on the functioning of the Workshop as a whole. I will present findings and observations to evaluate how well the workshop achieved its objectives.

== Reiteration of the Research Questions

TODO what does the workshop need to show?

As lined out in @hypothesis, the Workshop needs to be evaluated for three main research questions:
1. Did the workshop succeed in presenting a non-prescriptive scaffolding of exploration? is there an ideal balance between constraints and freedom?
2. does the workshop facilitate collaborative participation? Did that Collaboration bring about the re-valuation of objects? Did the Workshop create Value?

3. What is the impact on participants' attitudes towards waste management? Did the Workshop create new epistemes?
3a. How can novel archiving practices be integrated into artistic research and practice?
Where do we stand on the Archival of Knowledge? is that a net-useful practice?
Assuming there is this _persistent_ _knowledge_, what makes it knowledge? and how persistent is it?



== Criteria
TODO What are the evaluation Criteria?
How do we measure them?

The evaluation criteria for this thesis and workshop are structured to assess the effectiveness and impact of the proposed solutions.

The following points outline the key criteria for evaluation:

Participant Engagement and Transformation
Evaluate whether participants demonstrate a shift in perception towards plastic waste, viewing it as a valuable resource rather than disposable material.

Technical Feasibility and Usability
Assess the functionality and accessibility of the developed tools and processes, ensuring they are user-friendly and replicable in diverse settings.

Creative Outcomes and Innovation
Measure the diversity, functionality, and creativity of the objects produced by participants, reflecting the potential of recycled materials.

Sustainability and Impact
Examine the workshop's contribution to sustainable practices and its alignment with circular economy principles, including long-term usability and reduction of waste.

Knowledge Transfer and Skill Development
Analyze the participants' acquisition of new skills, understanding of material life-cycles, and ability to apply the workshop's methods independently.

Community and Collaborative Impact
Consider how the workshop fosters collaboration and builds networks among participants, encouraging collective action in recycling and sustainability.
These criteria will form the foundation for a comprehensive evaluation of the project's success and its potential for broader application.

== Workshop 1

=== Evaluating Participants Feedback
The End of the workshop featured a 20 minute feedback round, serving to evaluate the didactic aspects of the workshop as a format and potentially collecting evidence on a perspectival shift that occurred during the workshop. The Participants were asked to share a few insights and their views, especially regarding:

+ The open, explorative format,
+ the Utility of the UploadStation,
+ their perspective on the role of plastics in society.

==== Changes in Perception of Plastic as a Material
Participants expressed a shift in their view of plastic, recognizing its potential for creative reuse.
Initially, some saw plastic as waste, but the workshop demonstrated its malleability and potential for transformation. One participant noted,
#quote["It was really nice to experiment with everything, even though there was not like this one final product in the end."]

The ability to create new objects from discarded plastic was seen as an eye-opening experience.
#quote["We could easily see that new things can be made out of old things, and it's like a very nice thing."]
Some participants now appreciate plastic in a new way, even stating, #quote["I love plastic now after the workshop."]

==== Impact of the Hands-On Format
The exploratory, research-based approach allowed participants to focus on process over final products.
#quote["I was thinking beforehand which product to make, but it was nice that we were not focusing on the final product, but more on the process and on finding out something."]
Many found it liberating to experiment without pressure to create a finished item.
#quote["It was more for the sake of finding new things out and experimenting with something new instead of just trying to achieve something."]
The hands-on nature encouraged playful engagement and deepened understanding of recycling possibilities.
Participants valued collaboration, learning new techniques from each other, and overcoming technical challenges together.
#quote["So many people helped me along the way, explaining how to use the drill, the printer, and stick it together—it was a real group effort."]

==== Techniques and Experimentation
The workshop introduced various plastic manipulation techniques, such as using a soldering iron for fusing, molding, layering, and bubble-forming.
Experiments included making beams for furniture, translucent effects, and exploring different types of plastic.
#quote[I tried molding a strip of plastic onto a bottle, but it just stuck down on both sides — it was just nice to play around and try out different things.]

Documentation moments helped participants reflect on their process and material interactions.
#quote["Sometimes you get so deep into the making process, you forget that this is, you know, material, and then the documentation process gives you a little time to reflect."]

==== Ethical and Environmental Considerations
Some participants grappled with the ethical implications of re-purposing plastic:
#quote["Are we going to just produce more plastic in the end? Because we didn’t solve the problem yet."]

Concerns were raised about the energy and material loss involved in recycling plastic into new objects.
#quote["Making new things also costs—it costs energy, it costs money, you lose material."]
Despite these concerns, the consensus was that working with existing plastic is better than letting it go to waste. #quote["The plastic is there, it's not shrinking; might as well use it."]

==== Reflections on the Workshop Structure
Participants appreciated the open-ended nature, allowing for personal exploration.
#quote["I like that the workshop was two days because yesterday we explored things, and today we had an idea of what we wanted to make."]
Some felt that rather than finding one essential product to make, the focus should remain on experimentation and material understanding.
#quote["Maybe we have so many products already, it's not about finding one new product to make."]
The two-day format allowed for both exploration and more structured making on the second day.

The collaborative nature of the workshop was highlighted as a strength, with individuals supporting each other’s learning.

==== Future Directions and Next Steps
Some participants expressed interest in continuing to explore plastic manipulation, potentially visiting other community workshops.

==== Conclusion
The workshop successfully changed perceptions of plastic, offering a hands-on, experimental space for creative recycling. While some ethical meta-questions remain, the experience encouraged deeper engagement with the material and collaborative learning. Future iterations will refine the approach and explore applications in different settings.

   Here, the general structure for the archival uploads is already present: the created object, in this case an ID Marker made from a pressed PP sheet. Around it the different qualifiers, either realized as pictograms or written out notes. The image is linked to the archive page where it can be accessed and further explored.

  An example showing the adaptability of the archival process. Initially, the rigidity provided by forcing participants to adhere to the prepared camera perspective from overhead provided a stable training ground for getting to know the system. Later on, the hashtag function was introduced to allow for more flexible categorization of the data. On top of that, the camera became mobile, enabling novel perspectives and a less disrupted research process.

== Workshop 2
TODO Add content here after workshop

TODO what is the point of a second workshop after all? How does it generate novel insights?

=== How did the structure differ?

- different target group, now the workshop was attended by nine high-school-students in the tenth grade, 
having different expectations and needs than a range of art students, which partly already had their own artistic practice.
- different timing: we decided to stretch the course over three days instead of two.
- smaller and more careful selection of tools, since there was already a first empirical notion of things that are likely to be used.


TODO What was incorporated after the initial Evaluation and what was down to the difference in setting and target group?

=== Participant Outcomes and Insights
TODO add some uploads from workshop 2

=== Structural / Methodological insights
Although some of the setting
