== Why Plastics?
When talking about plastics, a polymer is meant. The word "polymer" originates from the Greek and can translate to "many units". Polymers can be defined as large, complex molecules, also known as "macromolecules," that are formed by the combination of many small repeating molecules called monomers. These polymers can have natural or synthetic origin. All plastics are polymers, they are a proper subcategory. The polymer group of the plastics is not a chemical definition, it is one by property. 
Something being _plastic_ refers to its deformability. 
All plastics are synthetic polymers
#cite(<oraonOrganicPolymersEnergyenvironmental2025>).
However, as  I will further use the term plastics and mean synthetic polymers at large.

The natural polymers like _cellulose_ are less relevant here and the deformability is a key aspect of this work. Since the terms are culturally closely associated, I will also introduce the term _plastics_ in this context and mean synthetic polymers at large.

Plastics have become both a cornerstone of modern innovation and a symbol of environmental degradation. After the success of the term "Anthropocene", the argument for the _Plastocene_ was convincingly made #cite(<prestonAtomAtmosphere2017>), marking the invention and industrial usage of plastics. It also acknowledges the fact that it will be discernible on a geological level when humanity started that process since plastics residue can and will remain as fossil layer.

The history of the base ingredient of plastics (petroleum) stretches back to previous
geological epochs, and its legacy will outlive us all.]

The introduction of Plastics transformed the course of industrialism globally and can be shown to be closely interwoven with modern capitalism.
They revolutionized packaging, enabling completely new scales of food storage and transportation.
Much like the story of the fossil fuels at large, as described by #cite(<malmFossilCapitalRise2016>, form: "prose"): Plastics are inherently a social catalyst by eliminating space and time akin to the development of steam engines and oil-based propulsion.
These brought about the crucial advantage in transportation for the British Empire, kicking off the colonial era.

Plastics have transformed on a similar scale:

#quote(attribution: cite(<farrellyPlasticLegaciesPollution2021>, supplement: "p. 1"), quotes: true)[
Plastics have revolutionized our lives. They have made possible things such as smartphones, modern cars, and LCD screens that depend on the light
weight, high strength, and electrical and thermal insulation of plastics.
They have enabled the production of disposable surgical equipment that ensures sterility, thereby minimizing inter-patient disease transfer. Countless lives have been saved, and the use of antibiotics has been reduced, as a result of lower levels of post-operative infection. Plastics allow the minimization of food contamination by harmful bacteria and reduce food-borne illnesses. ... On the face of it, plastics are good...]

The cultural image of plastic was shiny at its inception, it was the new super-material, it could do it all. Right after the discovery of the first polymers, plastics took the world by storm. One could say the positive image remained even in the late nineties with _...Life in plastic, it's fantastic..._ #footnote(link("https://genius.com/1613295/Aqua-barbie-girl/Life-in-plastic-its-fantastic")[Aqua - Barbie Girl])
the Song by Aqua and its rapid ubiquitous use. It is convenient for industry and consumer and 
We know by now, and already do since the late seventies, that plastics are responsible for a host of health concerns and it's now permanent presence inflicts serious ecological damage #cite(<macbrideRecyclingReconsideredPresent2012>).

As someone immersed in 3D printing, I frequently confront sustainability challenges.
Most 3D-printed parts are never recycled; instead, they contribute to the growing global waste problem. The 3D printer itself is indifferent to what it prints, concerned only with material purity and dimensional accuracy, yet the materials it uses often demand virgin plastic, perpetuating a cycle of consumption and waste.
Germany, as one of the leading producers and consumers of plastics, exemplifies the systemic reliance on virgin materials #cite(<PlasticsEurope2018>). Although some recycled filaments are available on the market, they are typically costlier and of lower quality, discouraging widespread adoption #cite(<sunVirginRecycledOptimal2020>). 
This disparity highlights a fundamental issue: the economic infeasibility of a robust, scalable recycling process for plastics. 
The core challenge lies in identifying and separating materials efficiently — a technological and logistical hurdle not yet overcome #cite(<volkTechnoeconomicAssessmentComparison2021>).

Despite these technological challenges, the willingness of individuals to engage in recycling is evident.
Yet, existing systems (policy and infrastructure) fall short of empowering individuals to recycle effectively. 

This disconnect raises the question: how can we reimagine the life-cycle of plastic, fostering both ecological sustainability and human agency?
While Samantha MacBride rightfully puts the focus on policy changes, changing infrastructure in a top-down approach
#cite(<macbrideRecyclingReconsideredPresent2012>),
I would argue that multiple pathways and opportunities should be explored, a bottom-up grassroots approach could overall prove less effective, but it is expected to give a bigger sense of agency to the recycling individual.

I need to stress here, that policy changes, _do_ work and should be the first priority. The often cited example is the UN Montreal Protocol to ban Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) #cite(<UNEP1987>).
People should vote and exercise democratic power, but one might feel inclined to _also_ bring their trash to small local recycling initiatives, because it lets one feel better about oneself.
It can offer a reclaimed agency, a sense of actively combating the effects of the ecological poly-crisis, where the enormous problem of plastics is just one among many.
There is a distinct transformative potential in participatory citizenship, as seen in the repair cafe initiatives independently popping up. Whenever these independent initiatives persist and network, sometimes in a translocal fashion, that amounts not only to a movement, but to the formation of new institutions and permanent change.  #cite(<spekkinkRepairCafesPrecious2022>).

The bottom-up direction of movement for sustainable change in recycling is manifold:
notable examples are the New European Bauhaus #cite(<EuropeanCommission_NEB>) and the social-media-like movement Precious Plastics #cite(<SayHiPrecious>). The latter exists since 2012 and evolved with little external help into an internationally renowned expert community. 

This thesis explores potential answers to this question by fusing theoretical insights with practical experimentation. 
By examining the intersections of human behavior, waste systems, and design innovation, it aims to uncover opportunities for a socially transformative relationship with plastics. 
The goal is to shift perspectives, treating plastics not as waste, but as a resource capable of storing enduring value.

In the last three years, studying to become an artist myself, a constantly surfacing topic was that of creative resistance.
The term "Counter-Hegemony" from #cite(<laclauHegemonySocialistStrategy2001>, form: "prose") stuck with me and during a project researching fences, borders and micro-nations, I stumbled on the anarchist concept of the _Temporary Autonomous Zone_ #cite(<beyTAZTemporaryAutonomous2011>). 
Both concepts invite their own forms of resisting hegemonial meaning-making. 
It seems to me that overwriting plastics-as-trash in the collective memory is more involved that simply wiping a storage section somewhere and defining a new concept. Some un-learning is required, a significant effort, one involving overwriting the known, the existent and the expected.

To this end, Material Ecocriticism #footnote[see further investigations in @material_ecocriticism following #cite(<oppermannMaterialEcocriticismCreativity2013>, form: "prose")] steps in with its feminist perspective, using the _"storied body"_ and the recognition of the necessary fusion of the ontologic and the epistemic into _onto-epistemology_ following #cite(<baradMeetingUniverseHalfway2007>, form: "prose") #footnote[find the details in @crucialconcepts].

This thesis aims to explore these intersections through a series of workshops and experiments that challenge the status quo of plastic waste management, while proposing alternatives relying on community-made mechanisms.

TODO

Now that we have the all-too-strong enemy and the field of discourse down, what is still missing is the secret sauce, the never-before seen tool that could aid in collective meaning-making:
Our archival practice through the AutomatedArchive.

Assuming science and technology with their plastic-eating bugs and proper top-down legislation are still on the far horizon, we would not want the next hackathon proposing yet a novel way to be unsustainable in a more efficient way.
We would want to know, we would want the knowledge to be shared to maximize participation effects and we would like the most flexible framework possible to contribute. #cite(<Wikipedia>, form: "prose") does many things right and I would argue the world with a tool like Wikipedia is a better one for it.
Due to its structure, it requires a vetted account, a peer-review system and many more mechanisms to try to ensure epistemic rigidity.
There are gender, race and also disparities in social status in the demography of the contributor's demographic #cite(<UNU-MERIT2010>). So some hindrance in equitable contribution can be assumed. What if we could extract some of the semantic richness from the Wikipedia model and apply it to a more flexible and collaborative platform? In this work, that will be the AutomatedArchive, a way of meaningfully contributing to persistent collective knowledge without some of the barriers (rightfully) posed in front of projects like Wikipedia?

With the backdrop of plastic waste as a global challenge, a collaborative workshop format is born, which tries to change perspectives on plastic objects surrounding us and playfully explore whether a co-creative learning process can contribute to a change in behavior towards waste. To support the workshop, a novel archival practice is outlined and tested. The Archive is a semi-permanent knowledge structure, and able to be used both for teaching and documentation purposes.


== The research hypothesis <hypothesis>

Essentially, three problems are identified within this work:

1. How can workshops benefit from the notion of them being pure infrastructure, a mere scaffolding to support exploration?
2. What properties are needed for a given infrastructure to support enable a re-narration of value in objects? #footnote[Further expanded in @crucialconcepts, see #cite(<beyTAZTemporaryAutonomous2011>, form: "prose") #cite(<Żyniewicz_2023>, form: "prose")]
3. How can we exercise all of this on an actual complex issue presenting a faceted and multidimensional problem that evidently cannot be tackled trough conventional problem-solving #footnote[Evidence provided in depth in @knowingwaste, see #cite(<hirdKnowingWasteInhuman2012>, form: "prose")], like plastic waste?

The Hypothesis: working communally, touching and transforming a material generates novel insights and shifts in perceived agency, not available through other forms of learning.
Capturing the knowledge generated in a communal setting such as a workshop and knowledge transfer to a usable, persistent state is hard and usually relies on often insufficient and short-falling individual knowledge-capturing strategies, resulting in an imbalance between the vast learning efficiency of interactive formats like workshops and their relative contribution to persistent knowledge-generating processes at large like those in scientific communities.
An automated archival process is expected to lower the hurdles of participation of laypersons in artistic research. A similar effect is expected for shared knowledge generation in general, even "hard-scientific" ones.
It is proposed that a prestructured archival process is epistemically superior by attempting to eliminate the effort of the documentation aspect from an artistic endeavor.
It hopes to sustain the benefits of reflection, while automating any aspects stopping free associative play.

I want to demonstrate that the communal process in the proposed workshop format is not only capable of providing didactic, or epistemic benefits, but I expect to find evidence for a deeper ritualistic process capable of rewriting material narratives, reinventing material meaning, essentially a novel value-creation process.

==== In this work
I will set the theoretical framework of the thesis in @sec:context, then I will talk about the rationale for the Workshop, it's preparation and present further documentation in @sec:workshop. There, I will also introduce the novel implementation of the AutomatedArchive to be found in @AutomatedArchive.
Finally, I will present the results of the workshop in @sec:evaluation and discuss their implications in @sec:discussion. The section also features potential further work and determines the utility of the introduced concepts for Education and research in general.
