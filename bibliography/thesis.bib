  abstract = {Early bio-based plastics, which were neither clean nor green, offer lessons for today Bioplastics are a broad category of materials encompassing bio-based, biodegradable, or both bio-based and biodegradable plastics. They can be manufactured from diverse sources, including crops (e.g., corn, sugar cane, and, historically, cotton), wood pulp, fungi, and other bio-based feedstocks produced with the help of algae or microbes. Some bio-based plastics, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and polylactic acid (PLA), are biodegradable under specific environmental conditions. Others, such as bio-polypropylene (bio-PP) and bio--polyethylene terephthalate (bio-PET), are also bio-based but are chemically equivalent to their conventional counterparts and do not biodegrade. Bioplastics can also include materials designed for biodegradation that are derived from fossil fuel--based rather than bio-based sources (1). Although bioplastics represent a small and growing segment within the industry, they are not a new idea and have a long history that is often overlooked or misunderstood.}

  abstract = {Bakelite ( BAY-kə-lyte), formally poly\-oxy\-benzyl\-methylene\-glycol\-anhydride, is a thermosetting phenol formaldehyde resin, formed from a condensation reaction of phenol with formaldehyde. The first plastic made from synthetic components, it was developed by Leo Baekeland in Yonkers, New York, in 1907, and patented on December 7, 1909. Bakelite was one of the first plastic-like materials to be introduced into the modern world and was popular because it could be moulded and then hardened into any shape. Because of its electrical nonconductivity and heat-resistant properties, it became a great commercial success. It was used in electrical insulators, radio and telephone casings, and such diverse products as kitchenware, jewelry, pipe stems, children's toys, and firearms. The retro appeal of old Bakelite products has made them collectible. The creation of a synthetic plastic was revolutionary for the chemical industry, which at the time made most of its income from cloth dyes and explosives. Bakelite's commercial success inspired the industry to develop other synthetic plastics. As the world's first commercial synthetic plastic,  Bakelite was named a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society.},

This article outlines the difficulties inherent in these approaches when it comes to understanding valuation of used goods. These approaches, somewhat paradoxically, obscure the greater situatedness of contextualized ``moments of valuation'' in material flows and in relation to production processes. The ecological approach developed here shows that moments of valuation are never divorced from temporally and spatially prior and subsequent moments of valuation and waste production, and cannot be fully understood if not considered alongside the conditions in which the goods being valued are produced. The subtractive logic of ridding is crucial in the processes of production and valuation of used goods. This article draws on ethnographic and interview data from fourteen months of fieldwork in England to show how used books are valued in an ecology that stretches across connected moments and sites.},

Although on the surface, simians, cyborgs and women may seem an odd threesome, Haraway describes their profound link as "creatures" which have had a great destabilizing place in Western evolutionary technology and biology. Throughout this book, Haraway analyzes accounts, narratives, and stories of the creation of nature, living organisms, and cyborgs. At once a social reality and a science fiction, the cyborg--a hybrid of organism and machine--represents transgressed boundaries and intense fusions of the nature/culture split. By providing an escape from rigid dualisms, the cyborg exists in a post-gender world, and as such holds immense possibilities for modern feminists. Haraway's recent book, Primate Visions, has been called "outstanding," "original," and "brilliant," by leading scholars in the field. (First published in 1991.)},

Furthermore, I argue that disposal is not just about questions of waste and rubbish but is implicated more broadly in the ways in which people manage absence within social relations. I develop this argument through a critical engagement with the work of Mary Douglas, Rolland Munro, Michael Thompson, and Robert Hertz. I seek to show that disposal is never final as is implied by the notion of rubbish but involves issues of managing social relations and their representation around themes of movement, transformation, incompleteness, and return. I suggest that rather than see the rubbish bin as the archetypal conduit of disposal within consumer practices the door might be seen as a better example. This has implications for understanding questions of representation, ethics, and the management of social relations within the practices of consuming.},

  abstract = {In Vibrant Matter the political theorist Jane Bennett, renowned for her work on nature, ethics, and affect, shifts her focus from the human experience of things to things themselves. Bennett argues that political theory needs to do a better job of recognizing the active participation of nonhuman forces in events. Toward that end, she theorizes a ``vital materiality'' that runs through and across bodies, both human and nonhuman. Bennett explores how political analyses of public events might change were we to acknowledge that agency always emerges as theeffect of ad hoc configurations of human and nonhuman forces. She suggests that recognizing that agency is distributed this way, and is not solely the province of humans, might spur the cultivation of a more responsible, ecologically sound politics: a politics less devoted to blaming and condemning individuals than to discerning the web of forces affecting situations and events. Bennett examines the political and theoretical implications of vital materialism through extended discussions of commonplace things and physical phenomena including stem cells, fish oils, electricity, metal, and trash. She reflects on the vital power of material formations such as landfills, which generate lively streams of chemicals, and omega-3 fatty acids, which can transform brain chemistry and mood. Along the way, she engages with the concepts and claims of Spinoza, Nietzsche, Thoreau, Darwin, Adorno, and Deleuze, disclosing a long history of thinking about vibrant matter in Western philosophy, including attempts by Kant, Bergson, and the embryologist Hans Driesch to name the ``vital force'' inherent in material forms. Bennett concludes by sketching the contours of a ``green materialist'' ecophilosophy.},

This paper explores the analytic potential of trash as a lens onto city-making and concludes that it is one of the mechanisms generating the distanciated and hyperlocal social textures of urban social morphology. Picking through the social morphologies of trash on the Koshe Landfill site on the fringes of Addis Ababa, I trace some of its local and translocal social textures.},

  abstract = {Hybrid conferences and events are becoming the norm and even after the pandemic, a majority of students are asking for hybrid education as a permanent format at universities. In parallel, hybrid learning, which allows participants to connect on-site or digitally, means greater logistical and cognitive effort for educators, as well as active, participatory support by students. In the wake of these newly emerging learning cultures, it is vital to design them sustainably and critically reflect their impact. In this workshop, participants are invited to co-design future learning artefacts and practices. The workshop is conceived as a playful participatory design format in which the relationship between technology, pedagogy and future skills will be reflected and translated into provocative future artifacts. Whether your interest lies in emerging technologies, education, future design or sustainability, your views and expertise are welcome. This workshop is framed within the overarching question of "how hybrid learning spaces can be designed sustainably?" and within the larger context of the third-party funded project "InK{\"u}Le - Innovationen f{\"u}r die K{\"u}nstlerische Lehre" at the UdK Berlin. The project InK{\"u}Le aims to develop and implement digital/hybrid forms of education using emerging technologies as well as interdisciplinary teaching and learning formats, as well as critically reflect their impact. The workshop results, therefore, contribute to the extensive discourse of the UdK Berlin and its university network of the Stiftung Innovation in der Hochschullehre.},

  abstract = {The global economy of e-waste recycling has received much attention in recent waste studies literature. This article gives an account from the inside of two different sites within a leading high-tech recycling and smelting company in which such e-waste is assessed; and discusses the valuation of electronic waste in the course of its industrial processing. Based on a two-month long ethnography by way of an internship, the article examines how the recycler manages to distinguish and separate out valuable `scrap', in contrast to valueless `waste'. The article subdivides the inquiry into two questions. What practices are involved when transforming e-waste into scrap and waste? And how can we appreciate differences in how they are configured? The study of two different facilities in operation next to one another provides additional leverage to the inquiry since the valuation practices involved when assessing the incoming e-waste differ between them. Differences are tied to specificities in how the electronics are sorted out, shredded, and smelted. The article shows how these processes of deformation are linked to the valuation practices and the accounting system of the company. Calculations, it is argued, succeed only because things are literally broken.},

  abstract = {The paper, based on an ongoing research project conducted in Finland, examines voluntary dumpster diving as a practice of valuation. Its main questions are: How is voluntary dumpster diving intertwined with the question of value? And, conversely, what can dumpster diving teach us about practices of valuation more generally? The article proceeds via three steps. First, in order to emphasize the creative side of dumpster diving as a practice of valuation, we draw on Georg Simmel's theory of value, supplementing it with the concepts of actuality and virtuality, as elaborated by Gilles Deleuze. Second, we look more closely into the practicalities of valuation evident in dumpster diving. It involves a particular orientation to the urban environment that we call the scavenger gaze. Third, the informants also value the practice itself in relation to its societal relevance. They think about dumpster diving as a way of doing good and as part of an ecologically sound form of life. All in all, as value does not reside inherently in waste or would simply be merely the product of subjective judgment, the analyst must attend to multiple modes of valuation evident in the practice, among which there is no self-evident hierarchy.},

  abstract = {In anthropology, liminality (from Latin  limen 'a threshold') is the quality of ambiguity or disorientation that occurs in the middle stage of a rite of passage, when participants no longer hold their pre-ritual status but have not yet begun the transition to the status they will hold when the rite is complete. During a rite's liminal stage, participants "stand at the threshold" between their previous way of structuring their identity, time, or community, and a new way (which completing the rite establishes). The concept of liminality was first developed in the early twentieth century by folklorist Arnold van Gennep and later taken up by Victor Turner. More recently, usage of the term has broadened to describe political and cultural change as well as rites. During liminal periods of all kinds, social hierarchies may be reversed or temporarily dissolved, continuity of tradition may become uncertain, and future outcomes once taken for granted may be thrown into doubt. The dissolution of order during liminality creates a fluid, malleable situation that enables new institutions and customs to become established. The term has also passed into popular usage and has been expanded to include liminoid experiences that are more relevant to post-industrial society.},

The accomplishments of the recycling movement can be seen in municipal practice, a thriving private recycling industry, and widespread public support and participation. In the United States, more people recycle than vote. But, as Samantha MacBride points out in this book, the goals of recycling -- saving the earth (and trees), conserving resources, and greening the economy -- are still far from being realized. The vast majority of solid wastes are still burned or buried. MacBride argues that, since the emergence of the recycling movement in 1970, manufacturers of products that end up in waste have successfully prevented the implementation of more onerous, yet far more effective, forms of sustainable waste policy. Recycling as we know it today generates the illusion of progress while allowing industry to maintain the status quo and place responsibility on consumers and local government.MacBride offers a series of case studies in recycling that pose provocative questions about whether the current ways we deal with waste are really the best ways to bring about real sustainability and environmental justice. She does not aim to debunk or discourage recycling but to help us think beyond recycling as it is today.},

Overturning established theories of the transition and offering a radically new view of our warming world, this study shows how steam was adopted as a superior source of power. Two centuries later, the inheritors of that power continue to profit from "business as usual," as the world heads toward irreversible catastrophe. Malm examines the history of resistance to fossil fuels and surveys the obstacles to the transition to renewable energy so urgently needed today.

  abstract = {"Founded by architect Walter Gropius (1883-1969) in 1919, the Bauhaus was the 20th century's most influential school of art, architecture, and design. After the school was shuttered under pressure from the Nazis in 1933, many Bauhaus artists brought their innovative practices and teaching methods to the United States. Gropius himself accepted a position at Harvard, where he would help establish a collection of Bauhaus material that has since grown to more than 30,000 objects-the largest such collection outside Germany. Harvard, in turn, became an unofficial center for the Bauhaus in America. Written by established and emerging voices in the field, the scholarship presented here expands on the special link between the two institutions, while highlighting understudied aspects of the Bauhaus, such as weaving, photography, and art made by women. Accompanied by beautiful illustrations-some of never-before-published objects-this book yields fascinating insights for Bauhaus devotees and design aficionados"--},

  abstract = {Today, the impact of the work of both Michel Foucault and Bruno Latour is increasingly evident in anthropology, most notably in the subfields of medical anthropology and the anthropology of science and technology. However, so far the oeuvres of these two thinkers have not been compared in a systematic fashion in the secondary literature. The present consideration intends a sustained comparison of their work to the end of problematizing the notion of the human or the anthropos. We suggest that both Foucault and Latour provide us with vital means to question human exceptionalism. Instead of calling upon the essence of human subjectivity by drawing on the notion of intentionality, for instance, they break open the interiority and autonomous hidden essence of the human. While Foucault does this mainly with his notion of the death of Man, Latour's work calls human essence into question by asserting the respective birth of non-humanity. We argue that it is especially the two thinkers' mutual concern with relationality that makes their work central to recent discussions of `posthumanism' by proposing a form of `ahumanism'. However, at the same time Foucault and Latour tend to neglect the `outside' of relations, although both see it as providing the resources for every assemblage.},

This account identifies waste, firstly, as the anomalous product of arbitrary social categorizations, or `matter out of place', and, secondly, as a distinctly human way of leaving behind and interpreting traces, or a mirror of culture. Together, these positions reflect a more or less constructivist and anthropocentric approach. Most commonly, waste is placed within a framework that privileges considerations of meaning over materiality and the threat of death over the perpetuity of life processes. For an alternative I turn to bio-semiotics and cross-species scholarship around the question of the animal. Specifically, the paper asks what theories of waste would look like if instead of taking `dirt' as their starting point, they began with trans-species encounters with animal scat. Following bio-semiotics and efforts to deconstruct the animal/human binary, it is suggested that the objectual forms commonly referred to a...},

Both practices are attuned to the indeterminacy and power of abandoned things, but in different ways. Whereas scavenging relies on acquiring familiarity with an object by getting to know its particular qualities, landfilling and other forms of mass disposal make discards fungible and manipulable by stripping them of their former identities. By way of examining the different ways in which people become invested in the politics of value at the landfill, whether as part of expressions of gender and class or for personal enjoyment, different comportments toward materiality are revealed to have underlying social and moral implications. In particular, it is argued that different approaches to the evaluation of rubbish involve competing understandings of human and material potential.},

  abstract = {The literature on the circular economy is dominated by visions that either disregard the role of civil society in (transitions to) a circular economy or depict civil society actors merely as passive consumers. However, there are organized citizen initiatives that align with circular economy thinking and that envision a much more active role for civil society in (transitions to) the circular economy. This paper explores Repair Caf{\'e}s and Precious Plastic as two examples of such initiatives based on exploratory questionnaire surveys conducted among the associated communities, supplemented with evidence from documents from the initiatives. Repair Caf{\'e}s and Precious Plastic can be understood as translocal communities that strive toward creating a circular economy through, for example, local repairing and recycling of plastic waste. This article is the first to study translocal communities in the context of a circular economy. In theory, such communities can develop transformative potential to challenge, alter and/or replace dominant institutions. This requires them to develop a critical mass, a shared identity and a political voice. The study shows that networking (and thus the development of critical mass) occurs primarily in specific countries (in the case of Repair Caf{\'e}s) and not necessarily community-wide (in the case of Precious Plastic). Evidence for a shared identity does exist in both communities, although more clearly in the case of Repair Caf{\'e}s. The study does not provide evidence for an explicit political voice developing in either community, although in the case of Repair Caf{\'e}s, the Repair Caf{\'e} International Foundation does take up lobbying activities. Thus, the ingredients for transformative potential in these communities are present only to a limited extent. This study contributes to the circular economy literature by showing how civil society actors can engage with (transitions to) the circular economy through organized citizen initiatives, a phenomenon that has thus far been largely neglected in the literature on circular economies. The study also adds to the limited pool of empirical knowledge on two rapidly growing citizen initiatives toward circular economies.},

By definition we discard it, from our lives and our minds, and it remains outside the concerns of conventional economics. However, this book explores the dynamics through which rubbish can re-enter circulation as a prized commodity, in many cases far exceeding its original value. Antiques, vintage cars and period homes, after being discarded as valueless, can, even after many years, become priceless. First published in 1979, Rubbish Theory has become foundational in its field. Today, it is as relevant as ever. This edition includes a new afterword revealing how the consequences of our compulsion to discard are far from inevitable, and going on to explore how we can transform our troublesome wastes into valuable resources.},

  abstract = {Abstract Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions need to be reduced to limit global warming. Plastic production requires carbon raw materials and energy that are associated today with predominantly fossil raw materials and fossil GHG emissions. Worldwide, the plastic demand is increasing annually by 4\%. Recycling technologies can help save or reduce GHG emissions, but they require comparative assessment. Thus, we assess mechanical recycling, chemical recycling by means of pyrolysis and a consecutive, complementary combination of both concerning Global Warming Potential (GWP) [CO2e], Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) [MJ/kg], carbon efficiency [\%], and product costs [{\texteuro}] in a process-oriented approach and within defined system boundaries. The developed techno-economic and environmental assessment approach is demonstrated in a case study on recycling of separately collected mixed lightweight packaging (LWP) waste in Germany. In the recycling paths, the bulk materials polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polyvinylchloride (PVC), and polystyrene (PS) are assessed. The combined mechanical and chemical recycling (pyrolysis) of LWP waste shows considerable saving potentials in GWP (0.48 kg CO2e/kg input), CED (13.32 MJ/kg input), and cost (0.14 {\texteuro}/kg input) and a 16\% higher carbon efficiency compared to the baseline scenario with state-of-the-art mechanical recycling in Germany. This leads to a combined recycling potential between 2.5 and 2.8 million metric tons/year that could keep between 0.8 and 2 million metric tons/year additionally in the (circular) economy instead of incinerating them. This would be sufficient to reach both EU and German recycling rate targets (EC 2018). This article met the requirements for a gold-silver JIE data openness badge described at http://jie.click/badges.},

  abstract = {Trash, garbage, rubbish, dross, and detritus - in this enjoyably radical exploration of `Junk', Gillian Whiteley rethinks art's historical and present appropriation of junk within our eco-conscious and globalised culture. She does this through an illustrated exploration of particular materials, key moments and locations and the telling of a panoply of trash narratives. Found and ephemeral materials are primarily associated with assemblage - object-based practices which emerged in the mid-1950s and culminated in the seminal exhibition `The Art of Assemblage' in New York in 1961. With its deployment of the discarded and the filthy, Whiteley argues, assemblage has been viewed as a disruptive, transgressive artform that engaged with narratives of social and political dissent, often in the face of modernist condemnation as worthless kitsch. In the Sixties, parallel techniques flourished in Western Europe, the US and Australia but the idiom of assemblage and the re-use of found materials and objects - with artist as bricoleur - is just as prevalent now. This is a timely book that uncovers the etymology of waste and the cultures of disposability within these economies of wealth.},

Poj{\k e}cia mattering i transmattering zaczerpni{\k e}te s{\k a} z j{\k e}zyka angielskiego, w kt{\'o}rym napisana zosta{\l}a dysertacja, i dotycz{\k a} szeroko poj{\k e}tych transformacji materii biologicznej i jej znacze{\'n}. T{\l}umaczenie tych poj{\k e}{\'c} na j{\k e}zyk polski znacznie zuba{\.z}a ich przekaz, dlatego zdecydowa{\l}am si{\k e} utrzyma{\'c} oryginalny zapis. W j{\k e}zyku angielskim s{\l}owo `matter' oznacza zar{\'o}wno materi{\k e} fizyczn{\k a}, jak i znaczenie b{\k a}d{\'z} wa{\.z}no{\'s}{\'c}. Zosta{\l}o to uwzgl{\k e}dnione w mojej rozprawie. W moich badaniach przyj{\k e}{\l}am, i{\.z} stanowi{\k e} materi{\k e} (zwan{\k a} w dalszej cz{\k e}{\'s}ci tekstu materi{\k a} osobist{\k a}), kt{\'o}r{\k a} poddaje transmatteringowi. Moje cia{\l}o i jego elementy, moja pozycja spo{\l}eczna oraz podej{\'s}cie poznawcze, w ko{\'n}cu relacje, w kt{\'o}rych funkcjonuj{\k e} podlegaj{\k a} nieustannym przemianom. Punktem wyj{\'s}cia dla moich rozwa{\.z}a{\'n} by{\l}y pytania: W jaki spos{\'o}b mog{\k e} u{\.z}y{\'c} siebie jako materia{\l}u i tematu badawczego? Co mog{\k e} odkry{\'c} dokonuj{\k a}c transmatteringu osobistej materii i powi{\k a}za{\'n} w jakich funkcjonuj{\k e}? Jak{\k a} histori{\k e} opowiada moje cia{\l}o? By odpowiedzie{\'c} na te pytania, przeprowadzi{\l}am szereg eksperyment{\'o}w na mojej osobistej materii, kt{\'o}re poddane zosta{\l}y autoetnograficznej analizie. W tek{\'s}cie okre{\'s}lam swoj{\k a} pozycj{\k e} poznawcz{\k a} jako liminaln{\k a}, z racji funkcjonowania pomi{\k e}dzy r{\'o}{\.z}nymi obszarami kreatywno{\'s}ci: humanistyk{\k a} (akademi{\k a}), sztuk{\k a} (galeri{\k a}) i biologi{\k a} (laboratorium). Swoj{\k a} intelektualn{\k a} histori{\k e} wywodz{\k e} z dziedziny sztuki, jednak prowadzone przeze mnie dzia{\l}ania liminalne zak{\l}adaj{\k a} wykroczenie poza ten bezpieczny kontekst w kierunku bada{\'n} akademickich i laboratoryjnych. Kluczowe dla moich dzia{\l}a{\'n} s{\k a} koncepcje dw{\'o}ch projekt{\'o}w: safe suicide i The Last Supper. Wymaga{\l}y one wykorzystania metod charakterystycznych dla nauk eksperymentalnych w laboratoriach biologicznych. Idee stoj{\k a}ce za oboma wymienionymi projektami wyznacza{\l}y okoliczno{\'s}ci moich bada{\'n} terenowych oraz ramy mojej autoetnograficznej narracji. Wszystkie wymienione obszary: humanistyka, sztuka i biologia odegra{\l}y rol{\k e} kontekst{\'o}w determinuj{\k a}cych transmattering mojej osobistej materii i przeciwnie, moja osobista materia pos{\l}u{\.z}yla do transmatteringu owych kontekst{\'o}w. Materia w moich rozwa{\.z}aniach ma status {\'s}ci{\'s}le ontologiczny (a nie tylko epistemologiczny) i jest wszystkim, czym jeste{\'s}my i co czyni nas usytuowanymi w {\'s}wiecie, w kt{\'o}rym {\.z}yjemy. Analizowanie materii w og{\'o}lno{\'s}ci przekracza{\l}oby zadania stawiane przed doktoratem, dlatego ograniczy{\l}am si{\k e} w swych dzia{\l}aniach do analizy tego, co dzia{\l}o si{\k e} z moj{\k a} osobist{\k a} materi{\k a} w czasie realizacji projekt{\'o}w: safe suicide i The Last Supper. Podczas gdy materia rozumiana jest przeze mnie jako stan ontologiczny, mattering traktuje jako operacj{\k e} epistemologiczn{\k a}, przeprowadzan{\k a} przez badaczy z r{\'o}{\.z}nych dziedzin. Na pewnym etapie moich bada{\'n} istotne okaza{\l}y si{\k e} pomys{\l}y teoretyczne proponowane przez badaczki z nurtu Nowego Materializmu. Koncepcje Donny Haraway, Karen Barad, Marie Puig de la Bellacasa, Serpil Oppermann, Serenelli Iovino i Jane Bennett stanowi{\l}y dla mnie znacz{\k a}c{\k a} inspiracj{\k e} teoretyczn{\k a}, do wykorzystania w analizie drogi przemian mojej osobistej materii. W takim rozumieniu, operacja ,,mattering'' uruchomiona przez wymienione badaczki, zlokalizowa{\l}a i utorowa{\l}a wielopoziomowe transformacje materii, tj. wyznaczy{\l}a mo{\.z}liwe szlaki {\.z}ycia i umierania. Powo{\l}a{\l}am do {\.z}ycia poj{\k e}cie `transmattering', by opisa{\'c} w{\l}asn{\k a} {\'s}cie{\.z}k{\k e} materialnych transformacji. Praktykowanie transmatteringu na bazie mojego cia{\l}a i jego element{\'o}w wyprzedzi{\l}o i w pewnym sensie antycypowa{\l}o teoretyczne odkrycia i analizy. Dzi{\k e}ki pozycji liminalnej i {\l}{\k a}czeniu sztuki, nauki, technologii i humanistyki oraz wykorzystaniu mojej osobistej materii, w jej aspekcie biologicznym, by{\l}am w stanie wykroczy{\'c} poza to, co daje czysto poj{\k e}ciowe pojmowanie matteringu.},
