- # Plastic Types and Properties
- ## PET (1): Polyethylene Terephthalate
  
  | **Category**    | **Details** |
  |----------------|------------|
  | **Description** | A strong, transparent plastic commonly used in bottles, jars, combs, bags, carpets, and ropes. Recently recycled into yarns for clothing. More complex to work with, so beginners should start with other plastics. |
  | **Properties**  | Lightweight, impact-resistant, rigid/semi-rigid |
  | **Pros**        | Strong and stiff, water and oxide barrier, good electrical properties |
  | **Cons**        | High mold shrinkage, heat degradation, harmful fumes |
  | **Safety**      | Medium |
  | **Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è**  | Harmful fumes during processing; some research suggests harmful materials may seep through long-term use. |
  | **Common Uses** | Blow-molded bottles (water, soda, juice), wrapping, film, electrical fittings |

- ## HDPE (2): High-Density Polyethylene
  
  | **Category**    | **Details** |
  |----------------|------------|
  | **Description** | Used for food and drink containers, motor oil, shampoo bottles, detergents, bleaches, toys, and bottle caps. Easier to collect, sort, and clean. Works well with Precious Plastic machines‚Äîgreat for beginners! |
  | **Properties**  | Inert, thermally stable, tough, high tensile strength |
  | **Pros**        | Cheap, high chemical resistance, good electrical properties, waxy feel, good friction behavior |
  | **Cons**        | Less stiff than PP, easy to burn, poor UV resistance, high mold shrinkage |
  | **Safety**      | Good |
  | **Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è**  | HDPE itself is not dangerous unless burned, but additives can be harmful and are often unknown. |
  | **Common Uses** | Pipes, toys, bowls, crates, packing film |
  | **Best Ways to Use with PP Machines** | Similar to PP, low melting temperature, easy to mold‚Äîgreat material to use! |

- ## PVC (3): Polyvinyl Chloride
  
  | **Category**    | **Details** |
  |----------------|------------|
  | **Description** | **Toxic ‚Äì do not use!** Common in plumbing pipes and releases harmful chloride when heated. Not recommended for Precious Plastic machines. |
  | **Properties**  | Insulating, chemically inert |
  | **Pros**        | Cheap, acid and alkali resistance, flame retardant, stiff, strong |
  | **Cons**        | Overheating causes degradation, brittle below 0¬∞C, discolors in strong UV light, releases HCl and dioxins when burned |
  | **Safety**      | **Not safe ‚Äì do not use** |
  | **Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è**  | Dangerous fillers, releases HCl and dioxins when degraded or burned. |
  | **Common Uses** | **Flexible**: Fake leather, seals, cable covers, tape. **Rigid**: Pipes, building materials, bottles, film, shoe soles. |
  | **Best Ways to Use for making** | **Don't use it!** |

- ## LDPE (4): Low-Density Polyethylene
  
  | **Category**    | **Details** |
  |----------------|------------|
  | **Description** | Used for plastic wrap, sandwich bags, squeezable bottles, and plastic grocery bags. Often not recycled due to labeling issues and lightweight nature but works well with Precious Plastic techniques. |
  | **Properties**  | Chemically inert, flexible, insulating |
  | **Pros**        | Cheap, chemical and hydrolysis resistance, high impact strength (low temp), good processability |
  | **Cons**        | Low tensile strength, low stiffness, low max temp, burns easily, poor UV resistance, high mold shrinkage |
  | **Safety**      | Good |
  | **Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è**  | LDPE itself is not dangerous unless burned, but additives can be harmful and are often unknown. |
  | **Common Uses** | Bowls, lids, toys, containers, film, squeeze bottles, pipes, bags, sheets |
  | **Best Ways to Use with PP Machines** | Not ideal for shredding but good for fusing with an iron or creating marble patterns. |

- ## PP (5): Polypropylene
  
  | **Category**    | **Details** |
  |----------------|------------|
  | **Description** | One of the most common plastics, strong and heat-resistant. Frequently used in food-related products like Tupperware, yogurt containers, and syrup bottles. Works very well with Precious Plastic machines. |
  | **Properties**  | Like PE but stronger, stiffer, higher temperature resistance, lower density |
  | **Pros**        | Mechanical, thermal, and electrical performance make it a low-cost engineering plastic |
  | **Cons**        | Higher cost than PE, brittle below 0¬∞C, high permeability to gases, poor fuel and UV resistance, keeps burning |
  | **Safety**      | Good |
  | **Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è**  | PP itself is not dangerous unless burned, but additives can be harmful and are often unknown. |
  | **Common Uses** | Structural parts, pipes, toys, chairs, kitchenware, DVD cases, packaging, films, textiles, carpets, rope, netting |
  | **Best Ways to Use for making** | Works well with all machines! **We love polypropylene!** |

- ## PS (6): Polystyrene
  
  | **Category**    | **Details** |
  |----------------|------------|
  | **Description** | Commonly known as Styrofoam but also found in many other products. Can be recycled but is energy-intensive. Found in disposable coffee cups, plastic food boxes, cutlery, and packing foam. Works well with Precious Plastic but is more toxic. |
  | **Properties**  | Clear, glossy, hard, stiff |
  | **Pros**        | Cheap, low mold shrinkage, good insulator, performs well at low temperatures |
  | **Cons**        | Brittle, poor wear and chemical resistance |
  | **Safety**      | Medium |
  | **Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è**  | Burning PS releases toxic styrene. |

- ## MIX (7): Miscellaneous Plastics
  
  |    **Category**    | **Details** |
  |---------------------|------------|
  | **Description** | This code identifies plastics that don‚Äôt fit into the other six categories, such as ABS, Acrylic, or Polycarbonate. These plastics can be difficult to recycle, but some can be processed with Precious Plastic. |
  | **Properties**  | Varies greatly depending on the plastic type. Some can be reused, but mixed plastics create chaos. üå™Ô∏è |
  | **Pros**        | Some good plastics to work with, like ABS, PLA, and Nylon. |
  | **Cons**        | Hard to identify and often unlabeled, leading to mixtures that are difficult to work with. |
  | **Safety**      | Finding the correct melting temperature is hard, especially for mixed plastics, increasing the risk of burning and toxic fumes. |
  | **Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è**  | Some plastics in this category (like PC) release very toxic fumes. Always research and test before processing in large amounts. |
  | **Common Uses** | **PC**: CDs, DVDs. **PLA**: Bioplastics. **ABS**: 3D-printing filament, toys, electronic products. **PMMA**: Acrylic glass. |
