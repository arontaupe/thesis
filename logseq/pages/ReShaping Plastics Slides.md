  Feedback on Workshop
	- ## Recap
	  What did you upload yesterday? 
	  Do you want to still document something from yesterday? 
	  What are your plans for today?
	  New groups? Same Groups?
	- ## Observations from Yesterday
	  I think we need a mobile Scanning function. 
	  The Phone can now also upload to the archive.
	  I would urge you to do more uploads, also in the process, not only the finished experiment.
	  Seeing a timeline of progress could help us learn more together :)
- ### Where are we and who are you? 
  I am Aron, he/him 
  and into plastic.
  I do a bit of 3D-Printing and teach making in schools. 
  I used to work for #InKüLe.
  I am a Design and Computation student and you are in our studio.
- ### Who are we?
  Introduce yourself,
  your background, 
  your current passion and 
  your goal for this workshop 
  if you want :)
  
  Have you built something with plastic already?
- ## What you need to know (Theory Block)
	- #### The types of plastic
	  ...or at least the relevant parts for makers...

- ### The Plastics we will use
  collapsed:: true
  PP
  PLA
  (HD)PE
	- ## [Polypropylene (PP)](https://www.makeitfrom.com/material-properties/Polypropylene-PP-Copolymer)
	  **Lightweight**: Low density, easy to handle and transport.
	  **Chemical Resistance**: Resistant to acids, alkalis, and solvents.
	  **High Melting Point**: 160–170°C, withstands higher temperatures.
	  **Durability**: Excellent wear and tear resistance.
	  **Electrical Insulation**: Acts as an electrical insulator.
	  **Non-toxic**: Safe for food packaging and medical use.
	  **Flexibility**: Good at room temperature, brittle in cold.
	  **Recyclability**: Recyclable, eco-friendly option.
	- ## [Polylactic Acid (PLA)](https://www.makeitfrom.com/material-properties/Polylactic-Acid-PLA-Polylactide/)
	  
	  **Biodegradable**: Breaks down naturally.
	  **Renewable**: Made from plant-based materials.
	  **Low Melting Point**: 150–160°C, limits high-temperature use.
	  **Transparent**: Ideal for packaging.
	  **Tensile Strength**: Strong, good for 3D printing.
	  **Non-toxic**: Safe for food contact.
	  **Brittle**: Degrades over time.
	  **Recyclable**: Compostable, not for regular recycling.)
	- ## [High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE)](https://www.makeitfrom.com/material-properties/High-Density-Polyethylene-HDPE)
	  
	  **Strong**: Durable and tough.
	  **Chemical Resistance**: Resists acids and solvents.
	  **High Melting Point**: 130–137°C.
	  **Rigid**: Less flexible than LDPE.
	  **Waterproof**: Excellent resistance.
	  **Non-toxic**: Safe for food use.
	  **Recyclable**: Easily recyclable.
	  **Impact Resistant**: Withstands impact.
- #### The 5 % Rule
  Do not let all these technicalities scare you: 
  Plastics can often be freely mixed and their properties are always a spectrum.
  As recyclers, it is impossible to know for sure, 
  just try it out!
  (as long as u keep the unknowns to less than 5 %, you can still expect similar performance)
- ## The Archive
  collapsed:: true
  What does that camera do?
	- Logseq is a markdown-based outliner app.
	  The camera is connected to a python script,
	  that analyzes and sorts any content into Logseq and sends it to 
	  https://archive.petau.net
	- The script runs OCR: it can detect written text.
	  It can read hashtags and applies them as tags to the upload.
	  It can read barcodes and QR-Codes.
	  It can describe images with LLMs (disabled since it seems pointless so far)
	  ![OCR](https://static.thenounproject.com/png/1718465-512.png){:height 188, :width 210}
	- ### It can detect markers.
	  What are markers?
		- {{embed ((67bc9d2c-44d0-44da-967b-acdc140e6e3b))}}
		- Markers are are based on template matching. 
		  You can place any combination of markers in the Frame 
		  and they will work exactly like hashtags.

  To participate as proper authors in the AutomatedArchive, you will need some ID.
  ID-Markers are not strictly necessary, but they enable a personalized upload history and help sorting later.
  As an initiation rite, you will make your ID-marker:
  Find some colors from the grains and fill about an espresso cup.
  Then: Make a cookie or any other shape on the #press
  Do not forget Baking Paper!
  Write Your (Nick-)Name with the Sticker Printer on it :)
- # Research Phase 1
  Form groups of 2 or 3 and see what first aspects you can find out and document.
  What is it that interests you most? 
  Which properties do you want to explore?
  Feel free to explore other aspects, this is a mere inspirational guideline.
- ## Research Groups
  + Color patterns
  + Connections  and Welding
  + Thermoforming
  + Surfaces
   ...any research you want to pursue?
	- ### Color Patterns
	  + Can we influence the color mixing? 
	  How to mix them? How to layer them?
	  Twist them? Fold them?
	  + Can we mix Materials?
	  + What influence does temperature have on color? 
	  Can we Overcook, undercook?
	  + transparency, tranclucency?
	- ### Connections, joints:
	  Welding: what creates strongest welds? 
	  Can they be reinforced? Can they be invisible
	  Can we create pin connectors?
	  Other, non-welded joint techniques?
	  How could we do hinges? 
	  Can we sew Plastic?
	- ### Thermoforming
	  + Could we do Slumping? (Melting Into a specific shape)
	  + Can we imprint or emboss details while hot?
	  + How can we bend the material? 
	  Are there Material differences?
	  + What can be done with elongation?
	  + Can we make it melt until liquid?
	- ### Surfaces
	  + What are ways to create regular or irregular patterns?
	  + Can we stamp patterns?
	  + How about inlays?
	  + Plastic into other materials? 
	  Other into plastic?
	  + Inscriptions or engravings?

  Thanks for listening!
  Enjoy building :)
