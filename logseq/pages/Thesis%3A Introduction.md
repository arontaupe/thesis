	- ### Why Plastics?
		- Plastics have become both a cornerstone of modern innovation and a symbol of environmental degradation. After the Success of the term "Anthropocene", People already made convincing arguments for the "Plastocene" [[@From Atom to Atmosphere]],
		  marking the invention and industrial usage of plastics and the fact that it will be discernible on a geological level when humanity started that process since plastics residue can and will remain as fossil layer. Plastics transformed the story of industrialism and can be shown to be closely interwoven with modern capitalism. It revolutionized packaging, enabling completely new scales of food storage and transportation, Much like the story of the fossil fuels at large [[@Fossil capital: the rise of steam-power and the roots of global warming]]
		- The cultural image of plastic was not too bad at its inception: one could say the positive image remained even with >[Life in plastic, it's fantastic](https://genius.com/1613295/Aqua-barbie-girl/Life-in-plastic-its-fantastic), the famous Aqua Song
		- ### History of plastics

		- As someone immersed in 3D printing, I frequently confront sustainability challenges. Most 3D-printed parts are never recycled; instead, they contribute to the growing global waste problem. The 3D printer itself is indifferent to what it prints, concerned only with material purity and dimensional accuracy, yet the materials it uses often demand virgin plastic, perpetuating a cycle of consumption and waste.
		  Germany, as one of the leading producers and consumers of plastics, exemplifies the systemic reliance on virgin materials. Although some recycled filaments are available on the market, they are typically costlier and of lower quality, discouraging widespread adoption. This disparity highlights a fundamental issue: the economic infeasibility of a robust, scalable recycling process for plastics. The core challenge lies in identifying and separating materials efficiently—a technological and logistical hurdle not yet overcome.
		  Despite these challenges, the willingness of individuals to engage in recycling is evident. However, existing systems fall short of empowering individuals to recycle effectively. This disconnect raises the question: how can we reimagine the lifecycle of plastic, fostering both ecological sustainability and human agency?
		  This thesis explores potential answers to this question through theoretical insights and practical experimentation. By examining the intersections of human behavior, waste systems, and design innovation, it aims to uncover opportunities for a socially transformative relationship with plastic. The goal is to shift perspectives, treating plastic not as waste, but as a resource capable of enduring value.
		  
		  With the backdrop of plastic waste as a global challenge, a collaborative workshop format is born, which tries to change perspectives on plastic objects surrounding us and playfully explore whether a co-creative learning process can contribute to a change in behavior towards waste. To support the Workshop, a novel archival practice is outlined and tested. The Archive is a semi-permanent knowledge structure, used both for teaching and documentation purposes.
