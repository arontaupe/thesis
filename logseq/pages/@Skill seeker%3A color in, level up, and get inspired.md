- [[Abstract]]
	- Skill Seeker is a practical solution for tracking growth and leveling up your skills. There is an overwhelming amount of things to do, from learning a new tech skill like 3D printing to traditional handiwork like sewing. What if we could gamify these parts of life and gain experience points for learning or doing something new? Skill Seeker does just that in a choose-your-own-adventure-style goal-setting guide book. Video games are famous for skill trees: A mechanism to visually see your progress, calculating your experience points and showing your level, unlocking badges and new abilities. Skill Seeker puts the concept of skill trees into real life. Featuring pathways to leveling up across 15 skill areas, including 3D modeling, crafting, electronics, entrepreneurship, metalworking, robotics, and woodworking. Use powerful gamification techniques of badging and leveling to your advantage to motivate a new stage of growth in your chosen skill areas. Show off your Life XP (experience) score, a tally of every tile completed across key areas, plus a dashboard of progress for a birds eye view of your skill distribution. Are you more tech-skill focused, or well balanced? Skill Seeker will identify your makeup, and chart a path toward whatever future you choose!
