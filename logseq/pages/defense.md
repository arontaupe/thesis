- intro
- supervisors, Human Waste: Recycling in social Contexts
- Core Components: Theory, Workshop, Machine Archivist
- Outline
	- Hypothesis
	- Concepts: Transmattering, Liminality, Rubbish Theory
	- Archiving, what for?
	- Creating the Workshop
	- Setup, Machines, Stations
	- Machine Archivist
	- Evaluation
	- Discussion
		- Why go analogue?
		- Why automate?
		- Why scavenging gaze in Education?
		- How to go on?
	- Questions
- History
	- Plastics as revolution
	- Plastics as disease
	- Plastics as Waste
	- Plastics as value
- Hypothesis
	- - What - Why - How
		- Thinking workshops-as-infrastructure, as Scaffolding
		- plastics-as-value through re-narration
		- combining workshop-as-infrastructure and archiving to create plastics-as-value
- Concepts:
	- Rubbish Theory
	- Knowing Waste - Hyperobject Hird Nuclear Example
		- Waste, defined as the discarded, always evades conceptualization
			- Logics, Technosolutionism, and scalable Industry never solve problem
			- Only way out: Haraway, Cyborg, Barad: Ontoepistemology
	- Transmattering
		- â€˜Mattering is simultaneously a matter of substance and
		  significance (Iovino and Oppermann)
		- Extraction, Change of context, Re-Matterization
	- The liminal is a precondition for transmattering
		- The Bracketed, the background, the ex-negativo definition, the ritualized un-learning, the fluid
	- Waste is Liminal
		- Waste can be re-narrated
	- The Scavenger-Gaze
		- Scavenging: The practice of collecting materials from Waste/Objects
		- something we can train
		- Implies we often cannot see the material in the object
	- Material studies
		- Just basteln...
		- Paper, ceramics, glass, steel
- Why Archive??
	- Workshop yields epistemes, but how to harvest? How to transfer?
	- We need a machine to transmatter knowledge
- Genesis:
	- Why not Filament?
	- Why Plastics?
	- Plastics are craftable. We just dont know about it yet
- Introduce the Workshop: All stations
	- Desk Area
	- Upload Station
	- Machines
		- Shredder
		- Material Station
		- Heat Area
		- CNS Station
		- Post-Processing
- Marker explanation: Taxonomy, Hashtags
- Back end description
	- Design goal: 1-click
	- Pre-sorted
	- Open World
	- Analogue, non-interruptive
