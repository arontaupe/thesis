	- Hypothesis
	- Archiving, what for?
	- Creating the Workshop

	-
- History
	- **Plastics-as-Revolution**
	- **Plastics-as-disease**
	- **Plastics-as-Waste**
	- **Plastics-as-value**
- Concepts:
	- **Rubbish Theory**
		- Durable, Transient, Rubbish
			- Value theory --> Economics, basically Stock Market
	- **Transmattering**
		- "Mattering is simultaneously a matter of substance and
		  significance" (Iovino and Oppermann)
		- Extraction, Change of context, Re-Matterization
		- **Liminality**: The liminal is a precondition for transmattering
			- The Bracketed, the background, the ex-negativo definition, the ritualized un-learning, the fluid
	- **Waste is Liminal**
		- Waste can be re-narrated
			- Therefore, plastics too
	- **Material studies**
		- Here is a material, explore its **affordances**
		- **Just basteln...**
		- Historic Examples: Paper, ceramics, glass, steel
	- Why Archive??
		- Workshop yields epistemes, but how to harvest? How to transfer?
		- We need a machine to transmatter knowledge
- Hypothesis
	- What - Why - How
		- Thinking **workshops-as-infrastructure**, as Scaffolding
		- plastics-as-value through **re-narration**
		- **Synthesis**: combining workshop-as-infrastructure and archiving to create plastics-as-value
- Genesis:
	- Why not Filament?
	- **Why Plastics?**
		- Plastics are young
		- Plastics are Industrialized, invisible: **Product vs Material**
	- **Plastics are craftable.** We just dont know about it yet
- Introduce the Workshop: All stations
	- show workflow graph
	- ()Fotos for each
	- **Desk Area**
	- **Shredder**
	- **Material Station**
	- **Heat Area**
	- **CNC Station**
	- **Post-Processing**
	- **Upload Station**
- Marker
	- **Marker for Taxonomy**, Hashtags
		- Markers as authorship
			- ID Markers serve for evaluation
		- Markers as taxonomy
			- Markers as hashtags
		- Markers serve as pre-structuring agent
			- Markers are reflection infrastructure
- Back end description
	- Show Overview graph
	- Design goals:
		- **1-click automation**
			- immersion in creation
			- no scientific housekeeping
		- **set-and-forget**
			- extensible
			- applicable as method to other wicked problems
		- **pre-taxonomized** --> categorized
		- Open World / Closed World as didactic choice
		- **Analog**, non-interruptive, minimally invasive
			- Why Paper / why analog?

- Discussion Elements
	- **Temporary Autonomous Zone** (Hakim Bey, Peter Lamborn Wilson)
	- **The Scavenger-Gaze**
		- Scavenging: The practice of collecting materials from Waste/Objects
		- something we can train
		- Implies we often cannot see the material in the object
		- Why **scavenging gaze in Education**?
	-
	- **The Makerspace**
		- “[We] identified four key “studio structures” as central to the design of studio learning environments: (1) in demonstration-lectures, teachers pose open-ended challenges, show exemplars, and demonstrate processes to engage and inform students, (2) in students-at-work, students work on their art and teachers circle the room observing and giving “just-in-time” instruction, (3) in critiques, the working process is paused as the group collectively reflects on student work, and (4) in exhibitions, students’ work is shared with a community beyond the studio classroom.”

	- Summary:
		- workshop as infrastructure
		- performative re-narration of value

	- Concepts
		- **Knowing Waste** - Hyperobject Hird Nuclear Example
			- Waste, defined as the discarded, always evades conceptualization
				- Logics, Technosolutionism, and scalable Industry never solve problem
