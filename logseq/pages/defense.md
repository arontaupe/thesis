  collapsed:: true
	- Hypothesis
	- Concepts: Transmattering, Liminality, Rubbish Theory
	- Archiving, what for?
	- Creating the Workshop
	- Setup, Machines, Stations
	- Machine Archivist
	- Evaluation
	- Discussion
		- Why go analogue?
		- Why automate?
		- Why scavenging gaze in Education?
		- How to go on?
	- Questions
- History
	- **Plastics-as-Revolution**
	- **Plastics-as-disease**
	- **Plastics-as-Waste**
	- **Plastics-as-value**
- Hypothesis
	- What - Why - How
		- Thinking **workshops-as-infrastructure**, as Scaffolding
		- plastics-as-value through **re-narration**
		- **Synthesis**: combining workshop-as-infrastructure and archiving to create plastics-as-value
- Concepts:
	- **Rubbish Theory**
		- Durable, Transient, Rubbish
			- Value theory --> Economics, basically Stock Market
	- **Knowing Waste** - Hyperobject Hird Nuclear Example
		- Waste, defined as the discarded, always evades conceptualization
			- Logics, Technosolutionism, and scalable Industry never solve problem
			- Only way out: Haraway, Cyborg, Barad: Onto-epistemology
	- **Transmattering**
		- "Mattering is simultaneously a matter of substance and
		  significance" (Iovino and Oppermann)
		- Extraction, Change of context, Re-Matterization
		- **Liminality**: The liminal is a precondition for transmattering
			- The Bracketed, the background, the ex-negativo definition, the ritualized un-learning, the fluid
	- **Waste is Liminal**
		- Waste can be re-narrated
			- Therefore, plastics too
	- **The Scavenger-Gaze**
		- Scavenging: The practice of collecting materials from Waste/Objects
		- something we can train
		- Implies we often cannot see the material in the object
	- Material studies
		- Here is a material, explore its **affordances**
		- **Just basteln...**
		- Historic Examples: Paper, ceramics, glass, steel
- Why Archive??
	- Workshop yields epistemes, but how to harvest? How to transfer?
	- We need a machine to transmatter knowledge
- Genesis:
	- Why not Filament?
	- Why Plastics?
		- Plastics are young
		- Plastics are Industrialized, invisible: **Product vs Material**
	- **Plastics are craftable.** We just dont know about it yet
- Introduce the Workshop: All stations
	- Fotos for each
	- **Desk Area**
	- **Upload Station**
	- Machines
		- **Shredder**
		- **Material Station**
		- **Heat Area**
		- **CNS Station**
		- **Post-Processing**
- **Marker for Taxonomy**, Hashtags
	- Markers as hashtags
	- Markers as authorship
	- Markers as taxonomy
- Back end description
	- Design goals:
		- **1-click automation**
		- **set-and-forget**
		- **pre-taxonomized** --> categorized
		- Open World / Closed World as didactic choice
		- **Analog**, non-interruptive, minimally invasive
	- Show Overview graph
	- Functionality:
		- Detect Marker
			- **Template Matching**
			- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**
				- Apple Vision Framework
		- Optional LLM
			- Ollama
			- LLM Caption
		- Markdown-base: Searchable, human- and machine-Readable
- Online Demo
	- Archive
		- Timeline
		- Graph
			- Pages, Tags
		- Page:
			- OCR
			- Photo
