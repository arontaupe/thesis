## Abstract
	- With reference to existing waste management systems, alternative con-
	  cepts for collaborative participation in recycling processes will be developed. Meth-
	  ods for the investigation of human-waste relationships will be applied, as well as
	  practical investigations to create a socially transformative relationship to the value
	  and non-value of waste.
