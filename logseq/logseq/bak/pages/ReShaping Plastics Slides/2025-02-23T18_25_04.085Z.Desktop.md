- ## The Plastics we will use
  PP
  PLA
  (HD)PE
- ## [Polypropylene (PP)](https://www.makeitfrom.com/material-properties/Polypropylene-PP-Copolymer)
  **Lightweight**: Low density, easy to handle and transport.
  **Chemical Resistance**: Resistant to acids, alkalis, and solvents.
  **High Melting Point**: 160–170°C, withstands higher temperatures.
  **Durability**: Excellent wear and tear resistance.
  **Electrical Insulation**: Acts as an electrical insulator.
  **Non-toxic**: Safe for food packaging and medical use.
  **Flexibility**: Good at room temperature, brittle in cold.
  **Recyclability**: Recyclable, eco-friendly option.
- ## [Polylactic Acid (PLA)](https://www.makeitfrom.com/material-properties/Polylactic-Acid-PLA-Polylactide/)
  
  **Biodegradable**: Breaks down naturally.
  **Renewable**: Made from plant-based materials.
  **Low Melting Point**: 150–160°C, limits high-temperature use.
  **Transparent**: Ideal for packaging.
  **Tensile Strength**: Strong, good for 3D printing.
  **Non-toxic**: Safe for food contact.
  **Brittle**: Degrades over time.
  **Recyclable**: Compostable, not for regular recycling.)
- ## [High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE)](https://www.makeitfrom.com/material-properties/High-Density-Polyethylene-HDPE)
  
  **Strong**: Durable and tough.
  **Chemical Resistance**: Resists acids and solvents.
  **High Melting Point**: 130–137°C.
  **Rigid**: Less flexible than LDPE.
  **Waterproof**: Excellent resistance.
  **Non-toxic**: Safe for food use.
  **Recyclable**: Easily recyclable.
  **Impact Resistant**: Withstands impact.
- ## The 5 % Rule
  Do not let all these technicalities scare you: 
  Plastics can often be freely mixed and their properties are always a spectrum.
  As recyclers, it is impossible to know for sure, 
  just try it out!
  
  (as long as u keep the unknowns to less than 5 %, you can still expect similar performance)
