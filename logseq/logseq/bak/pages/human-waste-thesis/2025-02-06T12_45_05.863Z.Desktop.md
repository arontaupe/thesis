	- ## Introduction
		- ### Why Plastics?
			- Plastics have become both a cornerstone of modern innovation and a symbol of environmental degradation. As someone immersed in 3D printing, I frequently confront the challenges of sustainability. The majority of 3D-printed parts are never recycled; instead, they contribute to the growing global waste problem. The 3D printer itself is indifferent to what it prints, concerned only with material purity and dimensional accuracy, yet the materials it uses often demand virgin plastic, perpetuating a cycle of consumption and waste.
			  
			  Germany, as one of the leading producers and consumers of plastics, exemplifies the systemic reliance on virgin materials. Although some recycled filaments are available on the market, they are typically costlier and of lower quality, discouraging widespread adoption. This disparity highlights a fundamental issue: the economic infeasibility of a robust, scalable recycling process for plastics. The core challenge lies in identifying and separating materials efficiently—a technological and logistical hurdle not yet overcome.
			  
			  Despite these challenges, the willingness of individuals to engage in recycling is evident. However, existing systems fall short of empowering individuals to recycle effectively. This disconnect raises the question: how can we reimagine the lifecycle of plastic, fostering both ecological sustainability and human agency?
			  
			  This thesis explores potential answers to this question through theoretical insights and practical experimentation. By examining the intersections of human behavior, waste systems, and design innovation, it aims to uncover opportunities for a socially transformative relationship with plastic. The goal is to shift perspectives, treating plastic not as waste, but as a resource capable of enduring value.

	- ## The Machines
		- ### The Shredder
			- The Precious Plastic Shredder is a versatile tool designed to efficiently break down plastic waste into small, manageable flakes, making it easier to process and recycle into new materials. Its robust design accommodates a wide variety of plastic types, enabling the creation of sustainable, high-quality outputs from discarded items. By offering an accessible and affordable solution, the shredder empowers individuals and communities to actively engage in local recycling initiatives and foster circular economies.
		- ### The Filastruder
			- This is the Filastruder, designed and made by Tim Elmore, in an attempt to create the cheapest viable way to extrude plastic. The biggest cost issue is the tight industrial tolerances in thickness that have to be adhered to. This is in essence what separates good from the bad filament. The industry standard nowadays is at +-0.03mm. Hard to achieve on a DIY setup, but not unheard of. The setup, like any bigger industry equivalent, consists of a motor pressing plastic pellets through a heated screw, extruding molten plastic at the end through a nozzle, and setting the diameter. The leftmost machine is responsible for winding the filament properly onto a spool.
			  
			  Here you can see the extrusion process in action.
			  
			  The Filastruder is controlled by an Arduino and is highly configurable. The laser sensor visible in the video is already working, but I am missing more direct control over the diameter of the filament.
			  
			  When it all really comes down to the single variable of the filament diameter responsible for the quality of my recycled project, a simple Machine Learning optimization directly jumps at me: I have a few variables like winder speed, extrusion speed, heat, and cooling intensity. These variables can be optimized on the fly for an exact diameter. This is actually roughly how virgin filament is produced, commercial facilities just manage much faster.
		- ### The Sandwich Press
			- In order to create sheet goods, some kind of flattening heat source is needed. After a bit of research into cost-effecticve solutions, a ribless sandwich maker was used. It is limited to sheets the size of A4 paper. Some modification might be necessary to ensure level sheets, since the pressure is only applied along the center axis, but for the first tests, this is sufficient.
			  It is comfortably reaching 200°C, which is enough for all plastics used in the context of the thesis. Some optimization could be achieved here by adding some form of Oven to keep plastic warm and enable larger batch sizes.

		- ## The Materials
			- There is hundreds of types of plastics, again with hundreds of additives like pigment for colors, or softeners or stiffeners, or even non-plastics like the wood-filament everybody loves. There is Composites, Batches, Virgin and Recycled... There is simply Too much to take care of in this Format. Therefore, we will deal with a dramatically condensed version of potential Plastics Materials. ((679f926f-a060-44bd-877a-8d259af7981d))
			- In 1971, the Society of the Plastics (http://www.socplas.org) established a standard for sorting Plastics that still prevails in much of the world. These Categories are so important, they have their own unicode symbol.

	- ## The Trash Theory
		- In the Book, [[@Rubbish Theory: The Creation and Destruction of Value - New Edition: The Creation and Destruction of Value - New Edition]] the author Michael Thompson argues that the value of an object is not inherent to the object itself, but rather a social construct. This is especially true for waste, which is often considered valueless and disposable. However, Thompson contends that waste can be transformed into value through social, cultural, and economic processes. By reevaluating our perceptions of waste and its potential, we can create new systems of value that promote sustainability and resourcefulness. This aims to go beyond teaching the participants how to recycle, but to fundamentally change their relationship to waste and the materials around them.

		- The Book establishes 3 fundamental value classes, transient, durable and rubbish. The Categories Transient and durable are no surprise here, they have been around in design theories for quite a while (TODO Cite). A transient object is simply an object expected to decrease in value over time, while a durable object is expected to increase in value over time. The third category, rubbish, is the novel thing introduced here.

	- ## The Workshop Concept
		- ### Reasoning behind the Workshop
			- Plastics pollution is one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time, yet recycling processes are often monopolized by industrial systems that prioritize economic efficiency over ecological sustainability. The ReShaping Plastics workshop aims to empower participants with hands-on experience in recycling and reimagining plastic waste as a valuable resource, fostering a sense of agency against an otherwise overwhelming global issue.
			  
			  This workshop is open to participants from all disciplines, requiring no prior experience. Over the course of two sessions, participants will learn to construct a DIY plastic sheet press and explore innovative methods for recycling plastic waste into durable and functional objects. The small group size (maximum 6 participants) ensures an intimate, collaborative environment tailored to the capabilities of the tools provided.
			- of c
			  
			  The workshop encourages a shift in perspective, treating plastic not as disposable waste but as a versatile material capable of new forms and functions. By engaging directly with the processes of sorting, shredding, heating, and molding plastic waste, participants will gain practical skills and insights into sustainable design practices and circular economies.
			  
			  The workshop balances technical instruction with creative exploration, culminating in the production of personalized objects such as engraved cutting boards, modular clamps, or experimental prototypes. Participants will leave with a deeper understanding of plastics' lifecycle and the tools to advocate for and contribute to ecological innovation in their communities.
			  
			  This is not just a recycling workshop—it's an opportunity to rethink waste, create tangible solutions, and spark a broader dialogue on sustainability and material culture.
		- ## The Exposee
			- This hands-on workshop invites participants to actively address plastic pollution by transforming waste into durable, meaningful objects. Unlike traditional industrial recycling, which often prioritizes economic over ecological concerns, this workshop empowers individuals to reclaim and repurpose plastic in a way that fosters creativity, sustainability, and personal agency.
			  The workshop unfolds in two sessions. In the first, participants will sort, wash, and shred plastic waste using a Precious Plastic Shredder, creating small flakes. These flakes will then be heated in a Panini press, transforming them into a malleable plastic mass, which will be molded using a DIY plastic sheet press. The resulting sheets will be finished with woodworking tools, and participants can add personal engravings with a CNC machine, allowing for unique, patterned designs.
			  The final products, shaped through a combination of heat, pressure, and craftsmanship, will reflect the individual designs and creativity of each participant. Whether through engraving or coloring, participants will gain hands-on experience with the potential of upcycling plastic waste into functional, aesthetic objects.
			  This workshop offers a tangible way to engage with the global issue of plastic pollution, encouraging participants to reconsider the life cycle of everyday materials. It is a way of reformulating transient objects into durable/lasting objects, an alchemical formula for design.
		- ### The Workshop Intent
			- What skills should the participants acquire?
			  
			  The workshop aims to equip participants with the following skills:
			  
			  The intent with the workshop is not educational. It is of course helpful to get to know more details one didn't know about types of plastic, but it is not assumed here that the participants will remember all the details. The intent is to change the participants relationship to waste and the materials around them. The participants should leave the workshop with a different perspective on the materials around them, and the potential of these materials. Just to view Plastics as a material source afterwards is already a significant change in perception.
			  
			  I love used furniture. I love restoring it, cleaning it, acknowledging that i made it possible it can last a few more years instead of going towards the trash. With the german Sperrmüll system, which is handled municipally, in many Towns discarded Objects spend quite a while on the streets before being actually discarded. It is a kind of limbo, the in the original sense of the word, a waiting hall where meaning and value is deducted until one is sorted into their proper category of hell. Despite a varying and disputed legal status, these Limbo-Objects on the streets have quite a following and are often taken in by passing-by people.
			  I also occasionally find some objects of value in these piles. They are kind of a rebalancing mechanism on the valuation economy of objects. I would argue that price is not the only category to measure value in our society, not even an idealized and theoretical one. Taking an about-to-be-discarded object in and attaching a new valuation to it is powerful and an everyday experience i think.
			  
			  A habit forms, one of scanning the environment for these kinds of liminal objects. The perception attunes and through the habit, my success rate of discovery of liminal objects increases.
			  
			  The workshop intends to exploit on this habit-making and perception-activating. The participants should leave the workshop with a renewed habit of scanning their environment for potential materials.
	- ### The ethics code
		- We need to strife to remove the paternalistic and colonial sapects of this scanning
		  
		  What is paternalistic about it?
		  
		  What is colonizing about it?
		  Merely walking the streets with the view of "How can it serve me?" is potentially quite a damaging perspective and i am not advocating for that here.
	- ### The Liminal object
		- What is a liminal object?
		  This is a category not formed by thompson, at least not explicitly. For me, the liminal object is within the transient object category. It is an object that is in the process of being discarded, but has not yet been fully discarded.

		  Is there a method to be extracted?
		  
		  Could the Process Knowledge be packaged and reduced in order to share on a website?
	- ### Workshop second Iteration
		- Within the context of my work in the studio einszwovier (https://www.gvb-berlin.de/unterricht-plus/arbeitsgemeinschaften/maker-space-studio-einszwovier/) at the Gabriele-von-Bülow Gymnasium, I was able to conduct a second iteration of the workshop. The workshop was conducted with a group of 10 students, aged 14-16, over the course of two days. The students were introduced to the principles of recycling and sustainable design, focusing on the transformation of plastic waste into functional objects. The workshop included hands-on activities such as sorting, shredding, and molding plastic waste, as well as creative exercises to explore the potential of recycled materials.
	- ## Evaluation
		- What are the Criteria? How do we measure them?
		  
		  The evaluation criteria for this thesis and workshop are structured to assess the effectiveness and impact of the proposed solutions. The following points outline the key criteria for evaluation:
		- **Participant Engagement and Transformation**  
		  Evaluate whether participants demonstrate a shift in perception towards plastic waste, viewing it as a valuable resource rather than disposable material.
		- **Technical Feasibility and Usability**  
		  Assess the functionality and accessibility of the developed tools and processes, ensuring they are user-friendly and replicable in diverse settings.
		- **Creative Outcomes and Innovation**  
		  Measure the diversity, functionality, and creativity of the objects produced by participants, reflecting the potential of recycled materials.
		- **Sustainability and Impact**  
		  Examine the workshop's contribution to sustainable practices and its alignment with circular economy principles, including long-term usability and reduction of waste.
		- **Knowledge Transfer and Skill Development**  
		  Analyze the participants' acquisition of new skills, understanding of material lifecycles, and ability to apply the workshop's methods independently.
		- **Community and Collaborative Impact**  
		  Consider how the workshop fosters collaboration and builds networks among participants, encouraging collective action in recycling and sustainability.
		  
		  These criteria will form the foundation for a comprehensive evaluation of the project's success and its potential for broader application. /zotero
