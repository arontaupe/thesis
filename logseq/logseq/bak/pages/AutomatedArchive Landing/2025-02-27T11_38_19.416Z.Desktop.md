- # Welcome to the AutomatedArchive
	- This Website is generated using #logseq , a Tool for creating and structuring knowledge in #markdown Format.
	- To the left, you find a search bar, to find any piece of knowledge you are looking for.
	- Also feel free to explore the graph view, which you can find in the left menu.
	- If you wish to add to this KnowledgeGraph, you can either do so via using the Scan function of the AutomatedArchive or clicking "Create" on the Host Computer. 
	  If you are seeing this in the Website version, you are dealing with a view-only version, where you should see all the content, but you will not be able to permanently modify anything.
	- Look at all the #upload's made with the AutomatedArchive here.
	- To get a more comprehensive view of the upload and to get inspired for more creation, go to [Pinry](https://pinry.petau.net)
