		- Add Inspo in there
		- I wanted to find a tool to make pinterest-style mood boards. Since i have no clue how that works and rarely use them, i started right there and made a pinterest board.
		  That got sticky fast and as i wanted it to integrate into my logseq graph, it has no easy way to embed into other services. on top of many FOSS related and data-privacy concerns, i quickly went for alternatives. there is raindrop.io, seems okay, but is paid. Then i found Pinry, which is poorly supported, but completely FOSS and even had a nice and working docker image. so i quickly spun ip an instance on my server and since it immediately worked, i stuck with it. It is public, has an API, meaning i can talk via python to it. So the idea of uploading posts to there and to logseq was born and implemented.
		  Now anything that goes through the Automated Archive, also ends up on there. on top, it can handle all kinds of external image-sources and even stores their links.
